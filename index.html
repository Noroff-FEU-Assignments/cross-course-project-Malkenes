    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would recommend choosing a hosting service that offers an SSL or TLS<br>certificate so that all the data moving between the server and web-browser is <br> encrypted. This will also allow you to use the HTTPS protocol. 
        <br><br>For user supplied input, especially sensitive like credit card information<br>Aswell as the URL you should set up a validation pattern to avoid XSS.<br>You also need to sanitize the input element by escaping and turning it into html<br>entities, rendering malicious scripts from running inert. 
        <br><br>As the client you should also limit privileges to your employees, only give<br>them access based on the features they need, if the employee only needs to be<br>able to edit the website, they should not have the option to add/delete users. 
        <br><br>Some potential security risks will depend on what kind of website it is. But<br>for those with sensitive information I would recommend Requiring a strong<br>password and/or two-factor authentication. 
        <br><br>Disable HTTP redirections. This might not be a security problem for your<br>site, but you do not want a client to be redirected from your site to a site<br>they can be compromised on. 
        <br><br>With all of this implemented you should have someone test the code, an<br>experienced developer who is familiar with security risks and third-party<br>applications like Pentest tools. </p>
